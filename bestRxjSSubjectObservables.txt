RxJs Subjects: A tutorial

If you have some experience with Angular, you’re probably familiar with Observables from RxJs.
This article is going to focus on a specific kind of observable called Subject. Subjects are observables themselves but what sets them apart is that they are also observers.
What does that mean? It means that a subject can emit data, on top of having the capability to be subscribed to. Let’s take a look at an example:
let subject = new Subject<string>();
// We subscribe to the subject
subject.subscribe((data) => {
  console.log("Subscriber got data >>>>> "+ data);
});

// We use the subject to emit data
subject.next("Eureka");

// Console result: Subscriber got data >>>>> Eureka
A regular observable does not have the next() method as regular observables are not observers. So that’s the first super power of a subject: Data emission.
Subjects are multicast
The second super power of subjects is that they support multiple subscriptions. In other words, they are multicast.
Subjects are like EventEmitters: They maintain a registry of many listeners.
let subject = new Subject<string>();

subject.subscribe((data) => {
  console.log("Subscriber 1 got data >>>>> "+ data);
});
subject.subscribe((data) => {
  console.log("Subscriber 2 got data >>>>> "+ data);
});

subject.next("Eureka");

// Console result:
// Subscriber 1 got data >>>>> Eureka
// Subscriber 2 got data >>>>> Eureka
As a result, you can use a Subject in a service to fetch some data, and send the result to all components that subscribed to that Subject.
There is one thing I would recommend though: Do not expose the Subject object directly to your components. Instead, return a good old Observable version of it:
// Don't do that or you subscribers will be able to "mess" with your // subject
getData(): Subject<Data> {  
    return this.subject;
}
// Do this instead:
getData(): Observable<Data> {  
    return this.subject.asObservable();
}
The above will make your code much safer and will prevent poor coding practices.
Behavior Subjects
Behavior Subjects are another cool thing about subjects. When you subscribe to a behavior subject, it will give you the last emitted value right away.
Imagine subscribing to a magazine, and right away you receive the latest published issue of it. Wouldn’t that be awesome? Welcome to the world of behavior subjects!
// Behavior subjects need a first value
let subject = new BehaviorSubject<string>("First value");

subject.asObservable().subscribe((data) => {
  console.log("First subscriber got data >>>>> "+ data);
});

subject.next("Second value")

// Console result:
// First subscriber got data >>>>> First value
// First subscriber got data >>>>> Second value
With behavior subjects, it does not matter when you subscribe, you always get the latest value right away, which can be very useful.
Now what if we want more than just the latest emitted value?
Replay Subjects
Replay Subjects keep a given number of historical values so that those values can be replayed to new subscribers.
// We tell the ReplaySubject how many values should be kept in      // history
let subject = new ReplaySubject<string>(2);

subject.next("First value");
subject.next("Second value");
subject.next("Third value");

subject.asObservable().subscribe((data) => {
  console.log("First subscriber got data >>>>> "+ data);
});

subject.next("Fourth value");

//Console result:
// First subscriber got data >>>>> Second value
// First subscriber got data >>>>> Third value
// First subscriber got data >>>>> Fourth value
In the above example, my Replay Subject keeps a history length of two values. As a result, as a soon as a new subscriber comes up, it gets the last two values, as well as any new value that comes up later on.
As you can see, Subjects are a very interesting… subject (that was easy!). We just scratched the surface of what they can accomplish, feel free to let me know if you’d like a follow up article with a deeper dive into what they can do.
